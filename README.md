# Housing property values and sale prices evaluation system.
This project predicts the values/prices of residential housing properties in Burlington, Vermont. An unbiased and objective evaluation of home prices based on big data is beneficial to both buyers and sellers of houses. While the sale prices/current values of housing properties are given in the “City of Burlington Property Details” data, it is not clear how various aspects of a house is related to its sale price/current value. We attempt to establish a predictive model to demonstrate the effect of various features of a housing property on its value. The “CurrentValue” and “SalePrice” information in the “City of Burlington Property Details” data set instead will be used to test the accuracy of our predictive model. The goal of this project is to give an estimated value or a range of estimated values based on the information on a housing property. Interested home buyers/sellers can use our established models of a house price evaluation system as a reference before making a decision on a transaction.
